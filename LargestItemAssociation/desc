The current selected programming language is Java. We emphasize the submission of a fully working code over partially correct but efficient code. Once submitted, you cannot review this problem again. You can use System.out.println() to debug your code. The System.out.println() may not work in case of syntax/runtime error. The version of JDK being used is 1.8.
In order to improve customer experience, Amazon has developed a system to provide recommendations to the customers regarding the items they can purchase. Based on historical customer purchase information, an item association can be defined as - if an item A is ordered by a customer, then item B is also likely to be ordered by the same customer (e.g. Harry Potter 1 is frequently ordered with Harry Potter 2). All items that are linked together by an item association can be considered to be in the same group. An item without any association to any other item can be considered to be in its own item association group of size 1.

Given a list of item association relationships, write an algorithm that outputs the largest item association group. If two groups have the same number of items then select the group which contains the item that appears first in lexicographic order.

Input
The input to the function/method consists of an argument - itemAssociation, a list containing pairs of items that are ordered together.

Output
Return a list representing the largest item association group.

Example
Input:
itemAssociation:
[[Item1, Item2]
 [Item3, Item4] 
 [Item4, Item5]]

Output:
[Item3, Item4, Item5]

Explanation:
There are two item association groups:
group1 : [Item1, Item2]
group2 : [Item3, Item4, Item5]
In the available item associations, group2 has the largest association.
So, the output is [Item3, Item4, Item5].
